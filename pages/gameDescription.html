                <p class="margin">Get ready for a wild, whimsical adventure in Crafty Critters! This competitive
                    heist board game invites players to join a daring band of
                    woodland critters on a mission to stock up for winter. As the leaves
                    turn golden and the first frosts appear, the animals know it's time to
                    raid the local grocery store to ensure they have enough supplies to
                    last through the cold months ahead. The goal is to gather enough
                    food to last through the winter before the store's closing time or
                    before too many alarms are triggered. Coordinate with your fellow
                    critters, use your wits, and pull off the ultimate grocery store heist!</p>
                <p class="margin">Will you and your critter crew pull off the heist of the season, or will
                    the store's defenses leave you out in the cold? Find out in Crafty Critters!</p>
                <p class="margin">Gather your team, plan your strategy, and let the heist begin!</p>

    <div class="gameDescription">
        <p class="middle-title">Game Dynamics</p>
        <p class="margin">An integral dynamic of the game is drafting critter cards and strategizing how you can use what you drafted 
            during gameplay. Various strategies can be invented, but players need to adapt on the fly since you cannot guarantee a specific 
            hand. Some common factors to consider are speed, pathing, avoiding obstacles and sabotaging other players. Having a varied hand 
            or a focused one are both valid dynamics for the gameplay experience.</p>
        <p class="margin">Players need to balance how quickly they get loot, as both player interference and suspicion can come into play and 
            make them lose Crafty Points if they get ahead too early in the game.</p>
        <p class="margin">Luck and chance are also a contributing factor to the game, for instance, getting a path tile you want or avoiding a 
            certain trap. The critters’ abilities can circumvent bad luck if used opportunely, but chance generates replayability and equalises 
            the field for less skilled players. </p>
        <p class="margin">Some specific successful strategies are to choose cards like Birds that will let you get to a high-value loot, like the 
            canned goods the quickest, then beeline to your exit and take the 2 Crafty Points, forcing others to make a dash to their own exits 
            while they have less points. Since players who have not left the map at the end of the game lose points, most players will not take 
            that risk and will try to leave. On the other hand, players who picked interfering cards such as the Owl, Bat or Butterfly can take 
            it slower and wait to sabotage whoever is in the lead. The trap card, Hook, can even let you steal loot from someone! Lastly, with a 
            clever combination of board manipulation from critters like Spider, Mole and Ferret, players can take advantage of the board and benefit 
            themselves while hindering others. Overall, numerous strategies can be used depending on your playstyle. We wanted players to have 
            differing methods of winning the game.</p>

            <div class="Trade-offs">
                <p class="middle-title">Trade-offs & Dilemmas</p>
                <p class="margin">
                    <p class="bold">Speed vs. Safety:</p>
                    <p>Do you make sure you have the speed to get to as much loot as possible, or do you take precautions to be able to 
                        avoid danger at the cost of speed or efficiency? Since you only have a limited amount of cards in your hand, 
                        missing a single card could be the key factor to winning or losing the game. Considering your strategy during 
                        drafting is a must. A player who is the quickest to get a lot of loot also becomes a target, prone to sabotage 
                        by the others. Or they may lack the abilities to deal with traps and security, leading to their own downfall.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="margin">
                    <p class="bold">Collecting Crafty Points vs. Sabotage:</p>
                    <p>Do you try to get as many Crafty Points as possible, focusing on yourself, or do you try to make sure the other 
                        players lose enough points to let you win the game? You would have to consider the strategies of your competition, 
                        your own progress and whether someone else was going to sabotage a target for you. Although you may have the most 
                        points in terms of loot, perhaps you take too many -1 CPs and someone beats you in the endgame.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="margin">
                    <p class="bold">Dilemma: Being the first to exit:</p>
                    <p>The first person to exit the game gets 2 Crafty Points at the cost of not being able to do anything afterwards. 
                        When leaving, you have to be confident that you have done enough to ensure your victory, or that you can foil 
                        the remaining players if they are unable to make it to a start tile when the game ends. The dilemma lies in 
                        anticipating the remainder of the game once you end your run.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="margin">
                    <p class="bold">Dilemma: Placing tiles:</p>
                    <p>When placing tiles, oftentimes many options lie before you. Take for example, placing tiles on a 4-way. 
                        You may choose to place disadvantageous tiles in whatever direction you were not planning to go, and 
                        take the risk that there is a tile you want for the route you are headed. This is effectively gambling. 
                        Or you can take a path tile that has a good route but has a trap or security marker on it, which may make 
                        you lose points later on. There are also other players’ to consider, as you may inadvertently help someone 
                        have a good path. Careful consideration or risky gambles are needed when it comes to tile placement.</p>

                    <p>A typical game lasts around 20-30 minutes. The hiring phase usually lasts 5 minutes or less,
